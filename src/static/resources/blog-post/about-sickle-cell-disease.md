# Sickle Cell Disease - The most common genetic disease in the world

#### May 11, 2020 by Hapsatou

**Sickle Cell Disease** also known as sickle cell anemia is an inherited genetic disorder that affects the hemoglobin in red blood cells.

Hemoglobin is the protein responsible for transporting oxygen through the blood. People with sickle cell disease have a so-called _"abnormal"_ hemoglobin. When the oxygen concentration in the blood decreases, hemoglobin in sickle cell patients deforms the red blood cells. These then take the form of sickles.

Sickle cell anemia manifests itself in particular by chronic anemia, extremely painful vaso-occlusive crises and vulnerability to infections.

Research has made a lot of progress in recent years, and the life expectancy of sickle cell patients has greatly increased. However current treatments remain limited.

This disease, although being the most widespread genetic disease in France and in the world, is very often ignored (including by many health centers).
